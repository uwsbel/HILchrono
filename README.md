# HILchrono
Code associated with human-in-the-loop experiments built off Chrono

The expected functionalities need to be achieved including:
1. Real-time simulation with single and multiple vehicles
2. Autonomous driving models, and functionalities to allow player to switch between autonomous control and human control
3. Reduced-Order vehicle models, including 2DOF, 4DOF, and 14DOF, to enable massive traffic simulations
4. Independent hardware and force feedback for easier HIL simulation implementation.
5. etc

This project code base is pegged to 'feature/hil' branch of the Chrono Fork: https://github.com/zzhou292/chrono
